The "source code" (spec files and so on) is hosted on GitLab at link:https://gitlab.com/redhat/centos-stream/rpms[].
All GitLab activity is forwarded to Fedora Messaging, and you can see these messages at the following URL: link:https://apps.fedoraproject.org/datagrepper/raw?rows_per_page=1&delta=127800&category=gitlab[].
